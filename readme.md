## Dairy Cafo
This is the unapologetically terse repo for the GUI wrapper developed for [Dairy-CropSyst](http://modeling.bsyse.wsu.edu/rnelson/Dairy-CropSyst/index.html).

Funding for this project has ceased so no further development is planned at this time.

### Final product: [http://modeling.bsyse.wsu.edu/rnelson/Dairy-CropSyst/index.html](http://modeling.bsyse.wsu.edu/rnelson/Dairy-CropSyst/index.html)
Dairy-CropSyst is a decision support tool for CAFOs managers and researchers to evaluate the effects of manure treatment options on net GHG emissions and manure nutrients fate applied to crop land.

### Webinar: [http://csanr.wsu.edu/webinars/anaerobic-digestion/signup/apr20/](http://csanr.wsu.edu/webinars/anaerobic-digestion/signup/apr20/)
Presented by Mr. Bryan Carlson, Associate in Research, Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State University. Join Bryan Carlson to hear about Dairy-CropSyst, a decision support tool for researchers and managers of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Mr. Carlson will provide an overview of the concepts behind the tool and guide the user through the process of inputting dairy information and interpreting the results. This tool models the fate of nutrients and emissions from manure excretion to field application, and its use provides insights into the effects of various manure treatment options. Mr. Carlson will discuss examples that explore the effects on nutrients and emissions of incorporating an anaerobic digester into a conventional dairy system.
